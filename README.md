# Art-Gallery-Website
Open source website for viewing arts and paintings. This website is being built as our DBMS project in fifth semester, Computer Engineering, Jamia Millia Islamia.


### What's inside

This website uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Flask] -  Python Web framework
* [Bootstrap] -  Our frontend framework



And of course this website itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
